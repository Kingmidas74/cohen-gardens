    December 1952, Brooklyn
    <br />
    Jack Russel's corner store
</q>
<p>It's always hard to be an immigrant. New places, new rules, new people around. The world has just begun to
    move away from that tragedy that had happened before, the war which had swiped all lands. Many people have
    not returned to their homes. Someone decided to stay in new places to find a better life. Someone did not
    have any option to choose. Fortunately, Jack belonged to the first ones.
    His family had run away from England prior to English Canal was crossed by a “Messerschmitt”. In fact, that
    escape was made from fear as history has shown, not that it matters anymore. He is just an alien, here and
    now, who got lucky to be in touch with his own kind. Strangely enough, most of the migrants moved to
    Brooklyn. </p>
<p>- Jack? - That voice reminded Jack he was not alone. The customer was looking at him waiting for reply. -
    Call
    them. You will be helped.</p>
<p>- Yes… Yes, thank you, Mr. Westler.</p>
<p>The gray-blue suited man tilted nodded. It looked like an approval moving rather than gesture of courtesy.
    And
    then that man turned and walked out of the store leaving Jack alone with his thoughts. The little storeroom
    was
    filled by tinkling bell sound for a few moments. There was a lot to think about. He looked around his store
    as
    if looking for a clue what he was supposed to do.</p>
<p>There were people on the street, under their umbrellas and wrapped up in their own problems. Nobody cared
    about
    his business except him. Well… It was not fair enough, to be honest. There was one woman who has been
    helping
    him with goods lately. Who knows maybe she'll agree to help him with one more thing.</p>
<p>A few hours later he was sitting in the Prospect Park. The rain had stopped, but there were almost no people
    here in that time of year regardless of weather, so they could talk without witnesses and on a fresh air at
    the
    same time. His acquaintance, whose name was Alice, sat next to him. She was a slim woman with a black
    ponytail,
    dressed in brown coat over thick wooly sweater and old fashion paneled long skirt. She was nervous because
    they
    were discussing their high risky and totally illegal idea, of course, but there was only one option, as he
    thought, to keep his business afloat.</p>
<p>- So… Do you think this might work? Can you do that?</p>
<p>- Are you sure we don't have any other choice? Jack, listen… It's just an idea, I've never ever tried this
    before in such large volumes… Where do you plan to get all this stuff by the way? I mean… it's kind of
    illegal,
    isn't it?</p>
<p>- Look around, Alice. If nothing changes, I'll go bankrupt soon. Your recipe is a way to salvation. I've got
    an
    address of some… people who can help us, but I am forced to ask you a favor to come with me. I can't do it
    alone, I'm the last one to know anything in all that chemistry science. Alice, please…</p>
<p>- I don't know, Jack. Give me some time, I'm a little scared in case you haven't noticed.</p>
<p>- Would you like some more cash? Isn't the percentage of revenue I promised you sufficient? It's our sole opportunity
    to avoid ending up in a Hooverville flophouse! I'll take care of all the business matters, and you only need to
    clarify your scientific things and nothing else!

    December 1952, Wislemn.
    <br />
    Funeral parlor “Cohen gardens”
</q>
<p>Is it here? Jack hesitated. On the one hand decision was made, on the other hand Jack was sure it could become his
    grave. The thought crossed Jack's mind that in case of slightly that not so, they never come back out of this
    parlor.</p>
<p>Breathing deeply, Jack had glanced at Alice and knocked at thick wooden door. After a few seconds he heard the
    steps. They were evaluated, Jack knew it. Whoever was there, behind this door, he wasn't pleased with uninvited
    guests. When door had been opened, Jack saw the man, who was nothing like the undertaker. To be fair, that was
    expected.</p>
<p>The well-built muscular man with a dry skin, who was looking at them, had a stem square face, long black hair. He
    was dressed in three-piece suit with the hat. The look on his stem square face was waiting for an answer to unspoken
    question. So… that how gangsters look like? Yes, it can be really is. Jack's throat had got dry.</p>
<p>- Can I help you? - That smoky voice was gruff and guttural. The silence stretched. Should have said something. -
    Have a nice day.</p>
<p>- No, no, wait… No…. We're at Aunt May's funeral.</p>
<p>It seemed to work. The man, who has already been closing the door, paused for extremely short moment as if lost in
    thoughts.</p>
<p>- What did you say? - The man had looked at Jack intently before looked down at Alice.</p>
<p>- We're at Aunt May's funeral. - She sounded more resolutely because she had got it the code was working.</p>
<p>- Come in. - The man had gone out and, holding the door, nodded to the guests they have to go first.</p>
<p>It should be noted, Jack was expecting the worst. However, the funeral parlor was like it supposed to be according
    to the title. There were wreaths, grave crosses, urns in bleak cramped entrance hall. It took a time to Jack's eyes
    to get used to dim light. Somewhere in the depths of the house music was sounded. This seemed unnatural to that
    place by Jack's opinion. The door had been slammed behind them with a dull thud and Jack felt his heart in his mouth
    once again.</p>
<p>- Leave your baggage. - He is a man of few words, Jack thought.</p>
<p>- We would like to present our product to Mr. Cohen… - Jack had taken his coat off and put it on the coat hanger. -
    Alice, please, could you show the test sample?</p>
<p>The girl had put her hand in bag, had took out a couple bottles with a dark liquid and then handed them to the man,
    who was waiting without enthusiasm. An awkward silence had fallen again. There was a feeling their odds of
    successfully getting out alive was decreasing in every second. However…</p>
<p>- Follow me.</p>
<p>When they were walking by the room with coffins, Jack felt horrific again. No, he was quite normal about the graves
    and all that stuff, because of he was at funeral many times, but here, in these circumstances, his mind painted
    pictures of possible future as if mockingly giving rise to thoughts about how that coffins were comfortable. The
    room with a workbench was left behind somewhere on the left side. Jack had thought it was a sort of workshop where
    the remains were be prepared to their last way.</p>
<p>They were getting closer to the source of music step by step. The room where they were brought was lighted by old
    dimmer lamps. There was a bar counter in one corner of the room, on which, in addition to glasses and bottles of
    drinks, was placed the radio. The big table was placed in the middle of the room and there were two men who played
    cards. Both were in suit, first one with a jacket and second one with a vest. And both had fell silent and looked at
    Jack and Alice.</p>
<p>- They know the code, boss.</p>
<p>Jack had already begun to get used to these appraising looks. His heart froze for a second in time to the music. He
    had seen Alice's pale face and followed to her look. There were revolvers on men's belts. Jack wasn't surprised.</p>
<p>- Who the hell are you? - The guy in the vest blown up at the wrong time. Maybe it was connected somehow with a
    smell of alcohol that emanated from him.</p>
<p>- Take it easy, Thomas. They are our guests. So, Archibald, bring some drinks to our guests. And you… sit down.
    Please.</p>
<p>Whether innate charm or maybe the gun, but something convinced Jack and Alice it was better to not speak till they
    were asked about and do what they were told.</p>
<p>- What about poker? Do you like poker? - A couple glasses of whisky were placed before Jack and Alice. Everything
    said they like poker, whenever like they or not. The man who called boss handed the card deck. - I'm listening.</p>
<p>Well… That is why they are here. Jack had started to tell his story. They had been discussing all details so many
    times while they were moving to Wislemn, but now, when they came into funeral home, Jack wasn't sure about they can
    do it. However, the more Jack told, the more confident his voice became. It's a simple idea! When one company make
    its product worse because of standards, rules and laws, this is the reason to take an advantage, isn't?
